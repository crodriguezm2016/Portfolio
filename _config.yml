  Hey! I'm Carlos and I'm aspiring to become a Data Expert who can find ways to give back to my community through teaching, mentoring, and more. 
  Starting college, I was studing nursing which made me take a statistics course and I fell in love with math.
  Next thing I knew, I had switch my major and the rest is history. Part way through college, I took a year off, moved to Denmark and spent the year working as a dean
  and teacher. This experience sparked my love for teaching, mentoring, and traveling. When I got back, I continued my degree in Mathematics and added a minor in Economics.
  I started working as a Teacher's Assistant for the Math and Business departments on campus which gave me the opportunity to teach and mentor students.
  During my final summer in college I got an internship at Motional where I worked as a Data Analyst on the Talent Acquisition team. 
  About 2 months before I graduated, I was extremely lucky to get an offer with New Relic and I have been working full time as a Data Analyst in People Analytics since then.

  In my free time, I spend most of my time learning, mentoring, making coffee, and gaming. Part of my learning involves working on new personal projects which you can find on
  my GitHub and even some down below. I have a huge passion for helping others find jobs and internships so I work with students from my alma mater to do resume reviews, carreer counseling,
  and networking. I am really into coffee as well! I just got an espresso machine (Lucca A53 Mini) so I have been making tons of cappuccino and other espresso drinks. Gaming is my main hobby for pleasure.
  I am pretty competitive so I wouldn't say it is always relaxing but I sure do enjoy it! For more information and details on this stuff, look at the final section on my website.

          I love seeing my listening stats and most listened to artists from Spotify at the end of the year. That got me thinking, what if I could see my Spotify Wrapped at any point in the year?
          This project guides users on how to download their Spotify data, allows them to upload it to the web app and then let's them customize their data experience.
          This project is one of my most recent projects so it was cool for me to be able to apply some new things I had learned like using lambdas and trying to create an experience that people would enjoy using.
          I have more ideas that I would like to implement with this project, so hopefully more to come soon.
          
          I created this project in **VS Code** using **Python**, utilizing packages such as **streamlit**, **pandas**, and **plotly**.

          This coding project takes voting data from the 2020 Presidential Election and compares it to COVID-19 death rates in the same county.
          I created a Choropleth map by county to show the percent of vote share that Joe Biden or Donald Trump received, as well as the death rate in that county from Covid.
          FIPS and a GeoJSON file are used to determine the county designations.
          A few different visualizations are made, with different focuses on the voting data vs the death rate data. 
          Covid data is pulled from the New York Times.
          
          I created this project in **Google Colab** using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebooks**, utilizing packages such as **pandas** and **plotly**.

          This is an R markdown file of my senior project. 
          This project used regression techniques and parameter estimation in order to fully build out a mathematical model of 3 Differential Equations that would predict and model public opinion polling. 
          Training and Testing Data was from the Gallop Polling Organizaiton.
          
          I created this project in **R Studio** using the **R programming language** and utilized packages such as **plotly**, **deSolve**, **ggplot2**, **plot3D**, and **rootSolve**.

          This web app allows a user to enter a stock ticker, choose the type of data they would like to pull (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Quarterly) and how far back they would like to pull data from.
          Once these are selected, data is pulled from Yahoo! Finance and graphs for the opening, high, low, and closing prices, as well as the volume of shares traded are displayed.

      Some more details about things I have been interested in lately:
      - Coffee: Currently, on espresso, I am drinking the Blue Orchid Blend from Huckleberry Roasters in Denver, CO.
      - Learning: Teaching myself some machine learning concepts from DataCamp. Also working on getting better at R and the tidyverse since I am currently more comfortable with Python.
      - Math: My math learning has taken a backseat lately but hoping to hop into some more statistics and distribution types.
      - Backpacking: Still reminiscing about the Tour du Mont Blanc which I did back in summer of 2019, pics of my trip can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pDKwUIW73xAk_3IKdI7oeG6KVyAbrZWW?usp=sharing).
      - Traveling: I've visited over 20 countries and am super excited to visit even more! Some of my favorite cities are Copenhagen (I'm biased), Venice, and Prague.
      - Gaming: Been playing a ton of Teamfight Tactics and managed to hit Diamond 3 for set 6! Check it out [here](https://lolchess.gg/profile/na/carlitos). I also just got Pokemon Legends Arceus so I expect to be playing that quite a bit as well.
